## Agent Notes

- Returns `LadderTournament` type — distinct from the player-created `Tournament` type returned by `/tournaments/{tag}`
- To get player rankings for a global tournament, use `tournamentTag` from results with
  `/locations/global/rankings/tournaments/{tournamentTag}` (see Locations reference)
- Returns empty `items` array when no global tournaments are active (not a 404)
- Global tournaments are Supercell-run events that appear on a schedule — they may not always be active
