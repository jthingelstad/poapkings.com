      <h2 class="sectionTitle">About the Clan</h2>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">Why did you create POAP KINGS?</h3>
        <p>Raquaza and King Levy have been playing Clash Royale for over three years, cycling through a variety of clans along the way. King Thing picked up the game a few months ago. We're all family, and after enough time in clans that didn't quite fit, we decided to build our own — one that matched our idea of what a clan should be. That was the genesis of POAP KINGS: structure, recognition, and something lasting to show for the grind.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">Why the name POAP KINGS?</h3>
        <p>King Thing loves making POAPs and sharing them with friends — it's a wonderful way to mark events and moments that matter. We decided to bring that passion into the Clash Royale clan world. POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) gives members a permanent, collectible record of each season. Kings because we aim high. "{{ site.tagline }}" is just our Clash-flavored spin on it.</p>

      <h2 class="sectionTitle">Joining</h2>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">How do I join?</h3>
        <p>We're {{ site.clanStatus | lower }} — no invite needed. Search <strong>POAP KINGS</strong> or use tag <strong class="mono">#{{ site.clanTag }}</strong> in Clash Royale. Minimum <strong>{{ site.minTrophies | formatNumber }} trophies</strong> to join.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">What are the clan rules?</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Be active</strong> — don't ghost a whole season without a heads-up.</li>
          <li><strong>Be generous</strong> — donate when you can.</li>
          <li><strong>Be decent</strong> — no toxicity, no drama.</li>
          <li><strong>Wars encouraged</strong> — participate when possible. Real life comes first; just communicate.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="sectionTitle">Clan Wars</h2>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">Do I have to participate in Clan Wars?</h3>
        <p>No. Encouraged but not required. Consistent participation and good vibes matter more than strict war requirements. That said, war performance is how you earn War Champ and Free Pass Royale eligibility.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">How is War Champ chosen?</h3>
        <p>Top Clan Wars point earner for the season, pulled directly from RoyaleAPI stats — no manual adjustments. Joining mid-season doesn't earn a handicap. Leadership breaks ties transparently.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="sectionTitle">Free Pass Royale Program</h2>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">What is the Free Pass Royale Program?</h3>
        <p>Top eligible war point earner each season gets a free Pass Royale, sent in-game. Real reward, no gimmicks.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">How does eligibility work?</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Highest war points among eligible players for the season.</li>
          <li>No back-to-back winners — can't have won last month.</li>
          <li>Points straight from RoyaleAPI, no adjustments.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">How are ties broken?</h3>
        <ol class="list">
          <li>Highest donations in the season wins.</li>
          <li>Still tied? Longest tenure in the clan wins.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">How will I receive the pass?</h3>
        <p>Sent in-game. No PayPal, Venmo, or cash transfers — in-game only.</p>
        <p><em>Exception: If you are under 16 and clan leadership knows you in real life, leadership will work something out.</em></p>

      <h2 class="sectionTitle">POAPs</h2>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">What is a POAP?</h3>
        <p>A POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) is a collectible digital token on the blockchain that marks your participation in a moment or event. Permanently yours, publicly verifiable. Learn more at <a href="https://poap.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">poap.xyz</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">What kinds of POAPs does POAP KINGS issue?</h3>
        <p>Two types:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Clan POAPs</strong> — mark clan-wide milestones: seasons, War Champ, founding. Issued to active members. POAP KINGS logo appears at the <strong>top</strong> of the design.</li>
          <li><strong>Member POAPs</strong> — recognize personal achievements like pushing past 10,000 trophies. These are yours to keep and share however you want, inside or outside the clan. Logo appears at the <strong>bottom</strong> of the design.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Logo position is the quick tell: <strong>top = clan milestone, bottom = your milestone</strong>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">What specific POAPs are issued?</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Seasonal</strong> — active members each season. <em>(Clan)</em></li>
          <li><strong>War Champ</strong> — top war contributor featured on the season POAP. <em>(Clan)</em></li>
          <li><strong>Achievement</strong> — personal milestones like 10k trophies. <em>(Member)</em></li>
        </ul>

      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">Do I need crypto knowledge to claim?</h3>
        <p>Nope. You'll get a claim link — click it and follow the steps. You'll need a free wallet but no purchases or blockchain knowledge required. New to it? Ask in the clan and we'll get you set up.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">What is a reservation?</h3>
        <p>A reservation reserves a POAP for you to mint in the future — it doesn't mint it right away. Once reserved, you'll receive an email with instructions to mint your POAP. From there you can create a new wallet or use an existing one. You need to complete the minting step to actually receive the POAP.</p>

      <h2 class="sectionTitle">Roles</h2>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">What's the clan composition?</h3>
        <p>Roughly every 10 members has 2–3 Elders and leadership. It scales as the clan grows — stays proportional, not top-heavy.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">What are the roles?</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Member</strong> — standard participant</li>
          <li><strong>Elder</strong> — earned through consistent donations and helping clanmates</li>
          <li><strong>Leadership</strong> — trusted veterans who run the clan</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">How do I earn Elder?</h3>
        <p>Donate consistently and be helpful. Elder can also be removed if donations dry up long-term — it's an active recognition, not a permanent title.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">How are promotions handled?</h3>
        <p>Clan leadership reviews promotions and other aspects of member management each weekend. Please do not request a promotion.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-q">What is the Members section?</h3>
        <p>The members section of the site — roster, roles, clan history. <a href="/members">Visit Members</a>.</p>
