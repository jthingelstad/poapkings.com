# Clash Royale API - Models

This directory contains response model notes split by domain for agent-friendly retrieval.

Use endpoint files for request behavior, pagination, cache notes, and operational quirks. Use these model files for
field shape, optionality, nullability, and shared nested objects.

Use [../game-modes.md](../game-modes.md) and [../wiki-api-crosswalk.md](../wiki-api-crosswalk.md) when a model field
needs gameplay context beyond its JSON shape.

## Recommended Lookup Order

1. Open [../index.md](../index.md) for common API behavior.
2. Open the endpoint file for the target route.
3. Open only the model file(s) referenced by that endpoint.
4. Check [errors.md](errors.md) when implementing error handling, pagination, or generic client primitives.

## Cross-Domain Notes

- Optional fields are usually absent rather than present as `null`.
- Nullable fields are called out explicitly in the relevant model file.
- `PlayerClan`-shaped objects are reused for player, battle, tournament, and ranking clan references.
- `GameMode.name` is reliably present in battle logs but may be absent in tournament payloads.
- Official Swagger often names wrapper models such as `BattleList`, `ClanMemberList`, `TrailEventList`,
  `TournamentHeaderList`, and `LocationList`. Local endpoint docs describe the observed JSON shape directly, including
  bare arrays where the live API returns them.
- Trophy Road, Ranked / Path of Legend, Clan Wars, events, tournaments, 2v2, and side-mode progress use different API
  signals. Keep gameplay interpretation separate from raw field shape.
