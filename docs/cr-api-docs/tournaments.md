## Endpoints

### GET /tournaments

Search tournaments by name.

**Query:**

- `name` — wildcard match. At least one filtering parameter is required; in live March 2026 tests, two-character values
  like `ab` still returned results.
- `limit`, `after`, `before` (pagination cursors — mutually exclusive)

**Returns:** `{ items: [...], paging: { ... } }` — array of `TournamentHeader` objects (summary data, not full detail)

**TournamentHeader shape:**

```json
{
  "tag": "#2GP0RGGU",
  "type": "open",
  "status": "inProgress",
  "creatorTag": "#822GUJ92L",
  "name": "a a a clash elite a a b 1",
  "levelCap": 11,
  "firstPlaceCardPrize": 0,
  "capacity": 74,
  "maxCapacity": 1000,
  "preparationDuration": 3600,
  "duration": 14400,
  "createdTime": "20260309T222248.000Z",
  "gameMode": { "id": 72000013 }
}
```

Note: `TournamentHeader` does NOT include `membersList`, `description`, `startedTime`, or `endedTime`. Fetch by tag for
full detail.

### GET /tournaments/{tournamentTag}

Get full tournament details.

**Path:** `tournamentTag` (required) — URL-encoded tournament tag

**Returns:** `Tournament` object with all fields:

| Field                 | Type     | Notes                                                              |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `tag`                 | string   |                                                                    |
| `name`                | string   |                                                                    |
| `description`         | string   | Optional — not always present                                      |
| `type`                | string   | `open`, `passwordProtected`                                        |
| `status`              | string   | `inPreparation`, `inProgress` (see note)                           |
| `creatorTag`          | string   | Tag of the player who created it                                   |
| `capacity`            | integer  | Current number of participants                                     |
| `maxCapacity`         | integer  | Maximum allowed participants                                       |
| `levelCap`            | integer  | Max card level allowed (observed: always 11)                       |
| `firstPlaceCardPrize` | integer  | Card prize for 1st place (observed: 0)                             |
| `preparationDuration` | integer  | Seconds before tournament starts                                   |
| `duration`            | integer  | Tournament duration in seconds                                     |
| `createdTime`         | string   | When tournament was created                                        |
| `startedTime`         | string   | Optional — when tournament started (absent during `inPreparation`) |
| `endedTime`           | string   | Optional — when tournament ended (absent if not yet ended)         |
| `gameMode`            | GameMode | `{ id }` — note: `name` may be absent in tournament context        |
| `membersList`         | array    | TournamentMember objects (see below)                               |

**TournamentMember shape:**

```json
{
  "tag": "#2RG0GRJ0U",
  "name": "ziikadaBalada",
  "score": 8,
  "rank": 2,
  "clan": { "tag": "#GC02QYJ", "name": "MaLibu JJ", "badgeId": 16000163 }
}
```

- `clan` is optional — absent if the player has no clan
- `score` = wins in the tournament
- `rank` = position on leaderboard

**Status enum (observed):**

- `inPreparation` — tournament created, waiting for start
- `inProgress` — tournament is active
- `ended` — tournament has finished (confirmed April 2026 via direct tag fetch; `startedTime` and `endedTime` are both
  present)

Note: Search may only return active tournaments (not ended ones). Tournaments in preparation may become unfindable by
tag after they start. Ended tournaments _are_ accessible via direct tag fetch.

**Type enum (observed):**

- `open` — anyone can join
- `passwordProtected` — requires password to join (this is what the in-game UI calls a "private" tournament)

Note: No separate `private` type was observed — in-game "private" tournaments map to `passwordProtected` in the API.

---

## Game Modes (player-facing names)

In-game UI exposes 16 tournament game modes. The API returns only `gameMode.id` (an integer) in tournament context —
`name` is typically absent in the `Tournament` payload (it _is_ present in `/players/{tag}/battlelog` battle entries,
but as an internal CR code like `CW_Duel_1v1`, not the player-facing name below).

| Player-facing name   | API id (when known) | Notes                                                                                                                   |

Mapping is empirical: observed ids carry over but the API does not publish a stable public mapping. Build the table
opportunistically as we host or observe each mode. The `tournaments.deckSelection` field sometimes hints at format —
`draftCompetitive` corresponds to "Triple Draft" in the in-game UI; `collection` is "Bring Your Own Deck"; plain `draft`
is "Draft" — but `deckSelection` does not distinguish between the elixir-rate variants (Normal vs. Double vs. Triple
Elixir Battle).

Keep any player-facing game-mode label mapping close to the code that emits or displays tournament data so raw IDs do
not leak into user-facing output.

## Error Codes

| Code | Meaning                                 |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| 400  | Bad parameters                          |
| 403  | Auth failure / insufficient token scope |
| 404  | Tournament not found                    |
| 429  | Rate limit exceeded                     |
| 500  | Server error                            |
| 503  | Maintenance                             |

Observed error bodies are usually `{ reason, message? }`. `GET /tournaments` with no filters returns `400 badRequest`
with `At least one filtering parameter must exist`. `type`/`detail` were not observed.

---

## Agent Notes

- Search returns `TournamentHeader` (summary) — fetch by tag to get `membersList` and full detail
- `GET /tournaments` requires at least one filter, but the older "3+ chars required" assumption for `name` was not
  reproduced in March 2026 testing
- `description` field is optional and may not be present on tournaments without one
- `gameMode` in tournament context typically only has `id` (no `name`) — unlike battle log where both are present
- Search only seems to return active tournaments (`inPreparation` or `inProgress`) — not ended ones. However, ended
  tournaments are accessible via direct tag fetch.
- Members can join during both `inPreparation` and `inProgress` phases
- No ordering guarantee on search results
- Treat search as discovery, not archival lookup. If search returns a tag you care about, fetch `/tournaments/{tag}`
  immediately.
- Do not assume search is complete, stable, or ordered by recency
- `levelCap` sets the max card level allowed — all observed tournaments had `levelCap: 11`
- `firstPlaceCardPrize` was always 0 in observations — may be a legacy field
- `preparationDuration` and `duration` are in seconds (e.g. 3600 = 1 hour, 14400 = 4 hours)
- `gameMode.id` values observed: 72000013, 72000194 — meaning varies; `name` field is absent in tournament context
- For ended tournaments, `startedTime` and `endedTime` are both reliably present alongside full `membersList` with final
  scores/ranks
