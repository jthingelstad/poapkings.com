## Endpoints

### GET /clans/{clanTag}

Get full clan info including member list, scores, description, badge.

**Path:** `clanTag` (required) — URL-encoded clan tag

**Returns:** `Clan` object with fields:

| Field               | Type     | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `memberList`        | array    | Full member list (see ClanMember below)                                                                                                                                                       |
| `location`          | Location | `{ id, name, isCountry, countryCode? }` — `countryCode` is a 2-letter ISO code, present only when `isCountry=true`; absent (not null) on meta-locations like `International` (id `57000006`). |

**ClanMember shape:**

```json
{
  "tag": "#UL2V9QRG0",
  "name": "raquaza",
  "role": "coLeader",
  "lastSeen": "20260309T125029.000Z",

}
```

- `role` values: `member`, `elder`, `coLeader`, `leader`
- `lastSeen` uses the same `YYYYMMDDTHHmmss.sssZ` format as battlelog
- `arena` is an Arena object with `id`, `name`, `rawName`

### GET /clans/{clanTag}/members

List clan members (paginated).

**Path:** `clanTag` (required) **Query:** `limit`, `after`, `before` (pagination cursors — mutually exclusive)

**Returns:** `ClanMemberList` — `{ items: [...], paging: { cursors: { after?, before? } } }`

Same ClanMember shape as above.

---

### GET /clans/{clanTag}/currentriverrace

Get the clan's active river race state.

**Path:** `clanTag` (required)

**Returns:** `CurrentRiverRace` with fields:

| Field          | Type          | Notes                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `state`        | string        | Observed `full` across all period types (training/warDay/colosseum) — `state` does not flip per day; `periodType` is the field that tracks the war's daily phase. |
| `sectionIndex` | integer       | Current section (week)                                                                                                                                            |
| `periodIndex`  | integer       | Current period within section                                                                                                                                     |
| `periodType`   | string        | Observed: `training`, `warDay`, `colosseum` (see notes)                                                                                                           |
| `clan`         | RiverRaceClan | This clan's data (see below)                                                                                                                                      |
| `clans`        | array         | All 5 clans in the race                                                                                                                                           |
| `periodLogs`   | array         | Historical period data for current race                                                                                                                           |

Note: `collectionEndTime` and `warEndTime` may not always be present (not observed in testing — may only appear during
active war periods).

**RiverRaceClan shape:**

```json
{
  "tag": "#J2RGCRVG",
  "name": "Sample Clan",
  "badgeId": 16000146,
  "fame": 0,
  "repairPoints": 0,
  "participants": [
    /* RiverRaceParticipant array */
  ],
  "periodPoints": 0,
  "clanScore": 160
}
```

Observed in live payloads after a clan finishes:

- `clan.finishTime` can appear on `GET /clans/{clanTag}/currentriverrace` and is usable as a live "race already
  finished" signal
- the sentinel value `19691231T235959.000Z` should not be treated as a usable live completion timestamp
- `trophyChange` is **not** present in the live `currentriverrace` payload; it appears in `/riverracelog` standings

**RiverRaceParticipant shape:**

```json
{
  "tag": "#RCCY80VG2",
  "name": "Ram",
  "fame": 0,
  "repairPoints": 0,
  "boatAttacks": 0,
  "decksUsed": 0,
  "decksUsedToday": 0
}
```

**PeriodLog shape:**

```json
{
  "periodIndex": 3,
  "items": [
    {
      "clan": { "tag": "#J2RGCRVG" },
      "pointsEarned": 3800,
      "progressStartOfDay": 0,
      "progressEndOfDay": 3311,
      "endOfDayRank": 0,
      "progressEarned": 3000,
      "numOfDefensesRemaining": 7,
      "progressEarnedFromDefenses": 311
    }
  ]
}
```

- `endOfDayRank` is **0-indexed** — `0` = 1st place, up to `4` for the 5th clan. A value of `-1` is a sentinel for "not
  yet ranked / day not finished" (observed across all period types in May 2026 sampling, ~2-3% of entries). Add 1 before
  showing players a 1-based placement, and treat `-1` as "pending", not as a placement.

---

### GET /clans/{clanTag}/riverracelog

Historical river race results (paginated).

**Path:** `clanTag` (required) **Query:** `limit`, `after`, `before` (pagination cursors — mutually exclusive)

**Returns:** `{ items: [...], paging: { cursors: { ... } } }`

**RiverRaceLogEntry shape:**

```json
{
  "seasonId": 130,
  "sectionIndex": 0,
  "createdDate": "20260309T095606.000Z",
  "standings": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "trophyChange": 20,
      "clan": {
        "tag": "#J2RGCRVG",
        "name": "Sample Clan",
        "badgeId": 16000146,
        "fame": 10000,
        "repairPoints": 0,
        "finishTime": "20260309T095604.000Z",
        "periodPoints": 0,
        "clanScore": 340,
        "participants": [
          /* RiverRaceParticipant array */
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The embedded clan object is the full `RiverRaceClan` shape (see [models/river-race.md](models/river-race.md)):
`periodPoints` and `clanScore` are always present on every standings entry. Both were observed on 200 of 200 standings
across 40 log entries sampled April 2026.

- `seasonId` is a sequential integer (e.g. 127, 128, 129, 130) — NOT the YYYY-MM format used for league seasons
- `sectionIndex` = week within the season. Most seasons are 4 weeks (sections 0-3) but some are 5 weeks (sections 0-4).
  Supercell varies the war season length to keep it roughly aligned with Pass Royale seasons.
- `standings` contains all 5 clans ranked by finish position
- `trophyChange`: regular weeks = ±20, final week (colosseum) = ±100. Colosseum is always the last section of a season —
  section 3 in a 4-week season, section 4 in a 5-week season.
- `finishTime`: normal value for clans that finished; sentinel value `19691231T235959.000Z` (epoch 0) for the final
  week/colosseum
- Prefer `finishTime` over fame thresholds when determining whether the race is finished

### ~~GET /clans/{clanTag}/currentwar~~ REMOVED

~~Get current classic clan war status.~~

**Status: Permanently removed.** Returns:

```json
{ "reason": "gone", "message": "This API endpoint has been permanently removed." }
```

---

### ~~GET /clans/{clanTag}/warlog~~ DISABLED

~~Historical classic clan war log.~~

**Status: Temporarily disabled.** Returns:

```json
{
  "reason": "notFound",
  "message": "This API endpoint has been temporarily disabled, possibilities to bring it back are being investigated."
}
```

---

### GET /clans

Search clans by filters. At least one filter required. If using `name`, it must be 3+ chars.

**Query:**

- `name` — wildcard match anywhere in name (case-insensitive). **Not required** — can search by other filters alone.
- `locationId` — filter by location (e.g. `57000249` for US)
- `minMembers`, `maxMembers` — member count range
- `minScore` — minimum clan score
- `limit`, `after`, `before`

**Returns:** `{ items: [...], paging: { cursors: { ... } } }`

Clan search results include a subset of clan fields:

```json
{
  "tag": "#J2RGCRVG",
  "name": "Sample Clan",
  "type": "open",
  "badgeId": 16000146,
  "clanScore": 67536,
  "clanWarTrophies": 160,
  "location": { "id": 57000249, "name": "United States", "isCountry": true, "countryCode": "US" },
  "requiredTrophies": 2000,
  "donationsPerWeek": 278,
  "clanChestLevel": 1,
  "clanChestMaxLevel": 0,
  "members": 22
}
```

Note: search results do not include `memberList` or `description` — fetch the full clan by tag for those.

## Agent Notes

- **Classic war endpoints are dead:** `currentwar` is permanently removed; `warlog` is disabled. Only river race
  endpoints are functional.
- Pagination: use `paging.cursors` from response to get `after`/`before` values. Empty `cursors: {}` means no more
  pages.
- `clanChestStatus`, `clanChestLevel`, `clanChestMaxLevel` are legacy fields — clan chests no longer exist in-game
- The full clan response (`/clans/{tag}`) includes `memberList` with all members; the `/members` endpoint offers the
  same data with pagination
- `badgeUrls` is **not** present in responses — only `badgeId` (integer). Badge images must be resolved via the badge
  ID.
- **Clan search:** `name` is not required — you can filter by `locationId`, `minScore`, `minMembers`, `maxMembers`
  alone. Search is case-insensitive.
- **River race structure:** A season is mostly 4 weeks but sometimes 5 weeks (Supercell adjusts to align with Pass
  Royale seasons). Each section has multiple periods (days). The final section is always colosseum week with higher
  trophy stakes (±100 vs ±20). Do not hardcode which `sectionIndex` is colosseum — use `trophyChange` from the log or
  `periodType` from `currentriverrace` to identify it.
- **`periodType` lifecycle:** In ~1,400 live captures over March–April 2026 only three values were observed: `training`
  on practice days, `warDay` on regular-week battle days, and `colosseum` on final-week battle days. Variants like
  `trainingDay` / `battleDay` appear in some community fixtures but were not seen on the wire — treat them as defensive
  aliases, not documented values. The `colosseum` value only appears once battle days begin; practice days of colosseum
  week still report `training`, so a "this is colosseum week" determination cannot be made from `periodType` alone
  during practice days.
- **Colosseum-week behavior:** The colosseum week has no boat battles and no boat defenses — only Colosseum duels and
  1v1s. Participant fields like `boatAttacks` and `numOfDefensesRemaining` will not advance, and battlelog `boatBattle`
  entries do not occur during colosseum week. Avoid surfacing boat-defense or repair-point copy when
  `periodType=colosseum`.
- **River race default limit:** `/riverracelog` returns 10 entries by default.
- **Race close time anchor — not a global clock, per-race and per-season:** `finishTime` on the rank-1 clan in
  `/riverracelog` entries is the moment the race closed, not when that specific clan met a threshold. In one sampled
  race set, 4 consecutive weeks of Season 130 varied by ±2 seconds (09:56:03 to 09:56:05) — far too tight for per-clan
  completion pacing and consistent with a scheduled server-side race-close job. At the Season 131 roll the anchor jumped
  ~19 minutes earlier (09:37:03) and stayed there. Working theory: Supercell stages matchmaking in batches at season
  roll, each race lands in a staggered close slot, and that slot is stable for the duration of the season. The REST API
  does not expose a `nextWarStart` / `timeUntilTransition` countdown. For approximate transition timing, derive the
  anchor from the most recent non-sentinel `finishTime` and assume it holds until the next season roll.
- **Non-rank-1 clans carry a sentinel `finishTime`:** only the rank-1 standings entry shows a real `finishTime`; the
  other four clans in the race show `19691231T235959.000Z` (epoch zero) because they didn't hit a completion condition.
  Don't treat the sentinel as a real time.
- **Member roles observed:** `member`, `elder`, `coLeader`, `leader`
- **Participant counts:** River race participants can exceed the current member count (includes players who left the
  clan during the race)
