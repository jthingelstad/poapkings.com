## Endpoints

### GET /cards

Get the full list of available cards in the game.

**Query:** Official Swagger lists `limit`, `after`, and `before`. In live March 2026 tests, those parameters were
ignored rather than applied, and the endpoint returned the full card catalog.

**Returns:** `Items` object with two arrays:

- `items` — 121 standard cards (troops, spells, buildings)
- `supportItems` — 4 Tower Troops

**Standard card shape (`items`):**

```json
{
  "name": "Knight",
  "id": 26000000,
  "maxLevel": 16,
  "maxEvolutionLevel": 3,
  "elixirCost": 3,
  "iconUrls": {
    "medium": "https://api-assets.clashroyale.com/cards/300/...",
    "heroMedium": "https://api-assets.clashroyale.com/cardheroes/300/...",
    "evolutionMedium": "https://api-assets.clashroyale.com/cardevolutions/300/..."
  },
  "rarity": "common"
}
```

**Support card shape (`supportItems`):**

```json
{
  "name": "Tower Princess",
  "id": 159000000,
  "maxLevel": 16,
  "iconUrls": { "medium": "https://api-assets.clashroyale.com/cards/300/..." },
  "rarity": "common"
}
```

Support items lack `elixirCost` and `maxEvolutionLevel`.

**Rarity → maxLevel mapping (observed):**

This is the API's rarity-relative upgrade scale, not a universal cross-rarity power scale. Higher-rarity cards have
fewer API level steps, but all rarities still top out at the same effective end-state when normalized.

| Rarity    | maxLevel |
| --------- | -------- |
| common    | 16       |
| rare      | 14       |
| epic      | 11       |
| legendary | 8        |
| champion  | 6        |

**Normalized interpretation:**

- `common`: API levels `1-16` -> normalized `1-16`
- `rare`: API levels `1-14` -> normalized `3-16`
- `epic`: API levels `1-11` -> normalized `6-16`
- `legendary`: API levels `1-8` -> normalized `9-16`
- `champion`: API levels `1-6` -> normalized `11-16`

Equivalent conversion from API `level` to normalized level:

- `common`: `normalized = level`
- `rare`: `normalized = level + 2`
- `epic`: `normalized = level + 5`
- `legendary`: `normalized = level + 8`
- `champion`: `normalized = level + 10`

**iconUrls variants:**

- `medium` — always present on all cards
- `heroMedium` — present on Hero-capable cards in live March 2026 sampling
- `evolutionMedium` — present on Evo-capable cards in live March 2026 sampling

**Observed interpretation for player-facing UX:**

- `maxEvolutionLevel=1` has only been observed on cards with `evolutionMedium` and no `heroMedium`
- `maxEvolutionLevel=2` has only been observed on cards with `heroMedium` and no `evolutionMedium`
- `maxEvolutionLevel=3` has only been observed on cards with both `heroMedium` and `evolutionMedium`
- This strongly suggests:
  - `1` => Evo-capable
  - `2` => Hero-capable
  - `3` => Evo + Hero capable
- This mapping is inferred from live API payloads. It is suitable for player-facing interpretation, but it does not
  prove slot-based activation behavior in decks.
- Player-facing output should prefer `Evo`, `Hero`, and `Evo + Hero` instead of raw numeric `evolutionLevel` wording.

**ID ranges (observed):**

- `26000xxx` — troops
- `27000xxx` — buildings
- `28000xxx` — spells
- `159000xxx` — Tower Troops (supportItems)

## Error Codes

| Code | Meaning                                 |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| 400  | Bad parameters                          |
| 403  | Auth failure / insufficient token scope |
| 404  | Not found                               |
| 429  | Rate limit exceeded                     |
| 500  | Server error                            |
| 503  | Maintenance                             |

Observed error bodies are usually `{ reason, message? }`. This endpoint ignored `limit=0` in March 2026 testing and
still returned the full catalog. `type`/`detail` were not observed.

## Agent Notes

- Global catalog endpoint — not player-specific. Use `/players/{playerTag}` for a player's collected cards with levels.
- `items` vs `supportItems`: Tower Troops (cards that replace/augment crown towers) are in `supportItems`; everything
  else is in `items`
- Pagination parameters appear to be ignored — `/cards?limit=1`, `/cards?after=...`, and `/cards?before=...` still
  returned the full catalog in March 2026 testing
- `maxLevel` is the rarity-relative API cap, not a normalized universal cap. Example: champions report `maxLevel: 6`,
  which corresponds to normalized level 16 at full upgrade.
- `maxEvolutionLevel` is optional — only 46/121 standard cards have evolutions (values observed: 1, 2, or 3)
- Observed icon correlation: `evolutionMedium` aligns with Evo capability, `heroMedium` aligns with Hero capability, and
  cards with both assets appear to support both
- No `paging` object is present in responses

## Cards Required to Upgrade

The CR API does **not** expose how many copies of a card are required to advance from level N to N+1. The
`/players/{playerTag}` `cards` array reports a `count` (copies the player has stockpiled), but no `cardsRequired` field.
To compute "is this player ready to upgrade this card right now," you must apply the public game table below.

Source: <https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Cards> (Cards Required Per Level table). These are stable game-data values
that change only with level-cap updates (~yearly cadence).

**Verified: 2026-04-25** — re-check the wiki when Supercell raises the level cap.

The list index is the count required to go from API level `N+1` to `N+2`, where `N` is the 0-indexed position. So
`common[0]` is the cost of the first upgrade (level 1 → 2).

| Rarity    | API levels (start → max) | Cards required, per upgrade step                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| common    | 1 → 16                   | 2, 4, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1000, 2000, 5000, 5000, 5000, 5000 |
| rare      | 1 → 14                   | 2, 4, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2000             |
| epic      | 1 → 11                   | 4, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1000, 1250, 1500                      |
| legendary | 1 → 8                    | 2, 4, 10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 100                                           |
| champion  | 1 → 6                    | 5, 10, 20, 50, 100                                                       |

(API levels are rarity-relative — see the normalization table earlier in this doc. A "common" maxes at API level 16, a
"rare" at 14, etc., and they all reach normalized level 16.)

The API does not expose this table directly. Implementations that need upgrade-readiness logic should keep this data in
their own game-data layer and re-check it when Supercell raises the level cap.
