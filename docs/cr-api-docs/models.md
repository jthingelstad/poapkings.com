# Clash Royale API - Model Reference

Field shapes verified against live API responses (March-April 2026).

This file is a routing page. Detailed model notes live in the `models/` directory so agents can load only the schema
area they need.

For gameplay meaning behind model fields, use [game-modes.md](game-modes.md) and
[wiki-api-crosswalk.md](wiki-api-crosswalk.md) alongside the focused schema file.

## Fast Lookup

- Need endpoint behavior first? Start with [index.md](index.md), then the endpoint file.
- Need a response field list? Open the model file for that domain.
- Need shared optionality rules? See [models/errors.md](models/errors.md) and the domain-specific model file.
- Need card level or `evolutionLevel` semantics? See [models/players.md](models/players.md) and [cards.md](cards.md).
- Need to map a field to Trophy Road, Ranked / Path of Legend, Clan Wars, events, tournaments, 2v2, or side modes? See
  [game-modes.md](game-modes.md) and [wiki-api-crosswalk.md](wiki-api-crosswalk.md).
