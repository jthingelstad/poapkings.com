## Global Tournament Rankings

### GET /locations/global/rankings/tournaments/{tournamentTag}

Get global player rankings for a specific tournament.

**Path:** `tournamentTag` (required, URL-encoded) **Query:** `limit`, `after`, `before`

**Returns:** `LadderTournamentRankingList`

Status note:

- Endpoint is documented and appears active
- Success shape was not re-verified in the March 2026 pass because `/globaltournaments` returned no active tournaments
- For agentic use, treat this endpoint as requiring fresh live validation before depending on exact field-level schema

---

## League Seasons (Global)

### GET /locations/global/seasons

List all historical league seasons.

**Query:** None

**Returns:** `{ items: [...], paging: { cursors: {} } }`

Items are `{ id: "YYYY-MM" }` objects. Note: early seasons (2016-2017) have duplicate entries for the same month. Season
IDs go from `2016-02` through the most recent completed season.

---

### GET /locations/global/seasonsV2

List league seasons with extended detail.

**Query:** None

**Returns:** `{ items: [...], paging: { cursors: {} } }`

**Current status:** Returns 137 items with all null fields (`{ code: null, uniqueId: null, endTime: null }`). This
endpoint is broken as of March 2026 — returns the correct count of seasons but with no data. Use `/seasons` (V1)
instead.

---

### GET /locations/global/seasons/{seasonId}

Get a single league season by ID.

**Path:** `seasonId` (required) — format `YYYY-MM`

**Returns:** `LeagueSeason` — `{ id: "YYYY-MM" }`

---

### GET /locations/global/seasons/{seasonId}/rankings/players

Get top trophy player rankings for a completed league season.

**Path:** `seasonId` (required) **Query:** `limit`, `after`, `before`

**Returns:** `PlayerRankingList`

**Current status:** Returns `{"reason":"notFound"}` for all tested seasons (2024 through 2026). In the March 2026 pass
the body contained only `reason` (no `message`). This endpoint appears to be permanently broken. Use Path of Legend
season rankings instead.

---

### GET /locations/global/pathoflegend/{seasonId}/rankings/players

Get top Path of Legend player rankings for a specific season.

**Path:** `seasonId` (required) — format `YYYY-MM` **Query:** `limit`, `after`, `before`

**Returns:** `{ items: [...], paging: { ... } }` — same shape as location PoL rankings

**Example:** `/locations/global/pathoflegend/2025-01/rankings/players?limit=2` returns:

```json
{
  "items": [
    { "tag": "#G9YV9GR8R", "name": "Mohamed Light", "expLevel": 70, "eloRating": 3874, "rank": 1, "clan": { ... } },
    { "tag": "#U8RYGC8GU", "name": "Polaris✨DEE", "expLevel": 57, "eloRating": 3844, "rank": 2, "clan": { ... } }
  ]
}
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Meaning                                 |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| 400  | Bad parameters                          |
| 403  | Auth failure / insufficient token scope |
| 404  | Resource not found                      |
| 429  | Rate limit exceeded                     |
| 500  | Server error                            |
| 503  | Maintenance                             |

Observed error bodies are usually `{ reason, message? }`. Invalid `locationId` values return `400 badRequest` with a
message such as `Unknown value for parameter locationId`. `type`/`detail` were not observed.

## Agent Notes

- `locationId` for global endpoints is the literal string `global` — e.g. `/locations/global/seasons`
- `/seasonsV2` is broken (all null fields) — use `/seasons` (V1) to get season IDs
- `seasonId` format is `YYYY-MM` (e.g. `2025-01`). Seasons go back to `2016-02`. Early seasons (2016-2017) have
  duplicate entries.
- Trophy rankings (`/rankings/players`) and Path of Legend rankings (`/pathoflegend/players`) are separate leaderboards
  for the same location
- `/rankings/clanwars` reflects river race performance, not classic war
- To get a `locationId` for a known country, fetch `/locations` and match by `countryCode` or `name`
- **Season trophy rankings are broken** — `/seasons/{id}/rankings/players` returns notFound for all seasons. Use PoL
  season rankings.
- `previousRank` of `-1` in clan rankings means the clan was not previously ranked
- **Global player trophy rankings** may return empty results early in a season. PoL global rankings and clan rankings
  work consistently.
- `/locations` returns all 262 locations with no limit by default. No pagination needed for the full list.
- `/locations?limit=0` returns `400 badRequest`
- Cache duration: location data is cached ~10 minutes server-side; rankings ~1 minute
