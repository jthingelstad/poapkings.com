**leagueStatistics shape:**

```json
{
  "currentSeason": { "trophies": 12530, "bestTrophies": 6650 },
  "previousSeason": { "id": "2026-02", "rank": 3288, "trophies": 7163, "bestTrophies": 7250 },
  "bestSeason": { "id": "2021-02", "rank": 926, "trophies": 7506 }
}
```

- `currentSeason` has no `id` or `rank`
- `currentSeason.bestTrophies` is optional — absent early in a season until the player exceeds their current trophies.
  `currentSeason.trophies` is always present when `leagueStatistics` exists. In April 2026 sampling, 7 of 17 players
  with `leagueStatistics` lacked `currentSeason.bestTrophies`.
- `previousSeason` and `bestSeason` include `id` (YYYY-MM format) and optional `rank`
- `previousSeason.bestTrophies` is also optional (observed absent on some early-previous-season carryovers)

**badge shape (progress badge):**

```json
{ "name": "Classic12Wins", "level": 1, "maxLevel": 8, "progress": 2, "target": 10, "iconUrls": { "large": "..." } }
```

**badge shape (one-time badge):**

```json
{ "name": "BeatingDeathBadge", "progress": 1, "iconUrls": { "large": "..." } }
```

One-time badges **omit** `level`, `maxLevel`, and `target` entirely (they are not present as `null`). Only `name`,
`progress`, and `iconUrls` are guaranteed. Example names observed April 2026: `CrazyArenaBadge1/2/3`, `EasterEgg`,
`2025YearBadge`, `BeatingDeathBadge`, `CrlSpectator2024`, `CrlSpectator2022`.

**achievement shape:**

```json
{ "name": "Team Player", "stars": 3, "value": 1717, "target": 1, "info": "Join a Clan", "completionInfo": null }
```

**Player card (in `cards` / `currentDeck`) vs catalog card:** Player cards include additional fields beyond the catalog:

- `level` (integer) — current card level
- `starLevel` (integer, optional) — cosmetic star level
- `evolutionLevel` (integer, optional) — **semantics depend on which array** (see below)
- `count` (integer) — copies currently held in stash (0 for maxed / currently equipped cards; volatile, consumed by
  upgrades)

**`maxEvolutionLevel` — card capability (static):**

- `maxEvolutionLevel=1` → card supports Evo mode only
- `maxEvolutionLevel=2` → card supports Hero mode only
- `maxEvolutionLevel=3` → card supports both Evo and Hero modes
- Absent / not set → card has no alternate mode

**`evolutionLevel` semantics — depends on the array it appears in:**

This field is **context-sensitive** across the three places it can appear:

| Appears in                                       | Meaning                                                                                          | Use case                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `cards[]` (full collection)                      | **Ownership** — the player has this mode unlocked                                                | "Does X own Evo Archers?"                           |
| `currentDeck[]` (active 8-card deck)             | **Deployment** — this card is currently slotted to play as the indicated mode                    | "What mode is X running Archers as right now?"      |
| Battle log `team[*].cards` / `opponent[*].cards` | **Played-as in that battle** — this card was actually played as the indicated mode in this match | "Did X play Evo Archers in this particular battle?" |

Evidence for deployment semantics in `currentDeck` and battle-log arrays (verified against 15,442 live battles, April
2026):

- `evolutionLevel` appears on only 2-3 slots per battle on average, never all 8 — matches Clash Royale's limited
  evo/hero slot count, not an ownership pattern
- A player can have dozens of evos unlocked in their `cards[]` but only see `evolutionLevel` populated on the 2-3 deck
  slots that are actually evo/hero slots
- `evolutionLevel=1` appears in slots 1-2 (evo slot positions), `evolutionLevel=2` appears in slots 2-4 (hero slot
  positions) — consistent with slot-mechanics behavior
- `evolutionLevel=3` is **never** observed on any deck/battle array (a slot plays as either evo OR hero, never both at
  once); it can only appear in `cards[]` to denote "both modes unlocked"

**Value mapping (all three contexts):**

- `evolutionLevel=1` → Evo
- `evolutionLevel=2` → Hero
- `evolutionLevel=3` → Evo + Hero (observed only in `cards[]`, never in deck/battle arrays)
- Missing `evolutionLevel` →
  - in `cards[]`: no alternate mode unlocked
  - in `currentDeck[]` / battle-log cards: card is not currently configured/played as evo or hero (either the player
    lacks the unlock, or the card sits in a non-evo/non-hero slot)

**Implementation guidance:**

- For ownership questions (upgrade advice, "do they have Evo X unlocked"), read from
  `player_profile_snapshots.cards_json`
- For deployment questions ("what's their signature card as Evo", "are they wasting an Evo unlock by putting it in a
  non-evo slot"), read from `currentDeck` or battle-log `deck_json` — both carry played-as state
- Player-facing output should prefer `Evo`, `Hero`, and `Evo + Hero` over raw `evolutionLevel` integers

**progress shape:**

```json
{
  "": {
    "arena": {
      "id": 168000059,
      "name": "Diamond",
      "rawName": "AutoChessArena10_2025_Oct"
    },
    "trophies": 4257,
    "bestTrophies": 4337
  },
  "AutoChess_2026_Season_8": { "arena": { ... }, "trophies": 3460, "bestTrophies": 3593 },
  "TripleDraftTrail": { "arena": { ... }, "trophies": 1820, "bestTrophies": 2110 }
}
```

Keys are opaque mode-season identifiers. The empty string key `""` is a legacy/default bucket. Clients should not
hardcode specific key names beyond treating them as labels — May 2026 sampling shows `AutoChess_2026_Season_8` (~90% of
profiles), `TripleDraftTrail` (~17%), and `AutoChess_2026_Mar` (~15%) alongside the always-present `""` bucket; new
mode/season keys appear over time.

Note: `gameMode.name` was observed on 100% of battles across March–April 2026 sampling (all tournament battles
included). Earlier notes suggesting `name` might be absent on some tournament modes no longer apply — treat `name` as
reliably present.

**Determining battle winner:** There is no explicit `winner` field. Use this order:

1. If `boatBattleWon` exists, use it.
2. Else if `team[0].trophyChange` exists, positive = win, negative = loss, zero = unresolved/draw.
3. Else if both sides have crowns, compare `team[0].crowns` vs `opponent[0].crowns`.
4. Else treat the outcome as unresolved.

For 2v2 battles, the outcome is still determined from the first team entry because both teammates share the same result.

**PlayerBattleData shape:**

```json
{
  "tag": "#PU9RCVYUG",
  "name": "FJ21",
  "crowns": 3,
  "kingTowerHitPoints": 9201,
  "princessTowersHitPoints": [6104, 6104],
  "clan": { "tag": "#GP8292Y8", "name": "Miyake YT", "badgeId": 16000054 },
  "cards": [
    /* 8 card objects */
  ],
  "supportCards": [
    /* Tower Troop cards, may be empty array */
  ],
  "elixirLeaked": 3.33,
  "globalRank": null,
  "startingTrophies": 12286,
  "trophyChange": 26
}
```

**Conditional PlayerBattleData fields:**

- `startingTrophies` — present on PvP, pathOfLegend, riverRacePvP, riverRaceDuel, friendly, clanMate
- `trophyChange` — only on PvP and pathOfLegend (positive=win, negative=loss)
- `globalRank` — present on all battles, null unless player is in top global rankings (then integer)
- `elixirLeaked` — float, present on all battles
- `supportCards` — array (may be empty `[]`)
- `rounds` — array, only on riverRaceDuel (best-of-3 duel rounds)
- `clan` — absent if player has no clan

**`cards[*].evolutionLevel` on battle-log cards is played-as state, not ownership.** If
`team[0].cards[n].evolutionLevel=1`, that specific card was played as Evo in that battle; `=2` means played as Hero;
absent means the card was played normally (or the player does not have evo/hero unlocked for it). This is
deployment-encoded — a player with Evo Archers unlocked who puts Archers in a non-evo slot will NOT have
`evolutionLevel` set on the battle-log Archers entry. See the `evolutionLevel` section under the player-profile docs
above for the full three-context semantics.

**Duel rounds (riverRaceDuel):** Both `team[0]` and `opponent[0]` have a `rounds` array (typically 2-3 rounds):

```json
{
  "crowns": 3,
  "kingTowerHitPoints": 7032,
  "princessTowersHitPoints": [4424, 3959],
  "elixirLeaked": 2.1,
  "cards": [
    /* 8 cards, each has an additional 'used': true/false field */
  ]
}
```

The `used` boolean on each card in a round indicates if that card was played. Each round has a different deck (3 decks
total for duels).

**CHAOS mode modifiers (type=trail with Crazy_Arena):**

```json
[
  { "tag": "#PU9RCVYUG", "modifiers": ["Pekka3", "Graveyard2", "Rage1"] },
  { "tag": "#2JVGV9CG9", "modifiers": ["Fireball3", "GoblinHut2", "Berserker1"] }
]
```

Each entry maps a player tag to their chosen modifiers. Only present in CHAOS mode battles.

### POST /players/{playerTag}/verifytoken RESTRICTED

Verify a player-owned in-game API token against a player tag.

**Current status:** Restricted. The current official Swagger UI includes `VerifyTokenRequest` and `VerifyTokenResponse`
models but does not render this operation in the public operation list. A live test on 2026-06-17 using a valid
developer API key that can read `GET /players/{playerTag}` returned:

```json
{
  "reason": "accessDenied.invalidScope",
  "message": "Invalid authorization: API key does not allow access to the requested resource."
}
```

Treat this endpoint as unavailable to normal public API keys unless Supercell grants the key an additional scope.

**Path:** `playerTag` (required) — URL-encoded player tag. The value must be an in-game Clash Royale player tag such as
`#2ABC`, encoded as `%232ABC`. Supercell ID/account identifiers are not valid here.

**Body:**

```json
{ "token": "player-generated-token" }
```

This body token is the in-game API token generated by the player, not the developer API key. The developer API key still
goes in the `Authorization: Bearer ...` header.

**Expected response shape if the key has access:**

```json
{ "tag": "#PLAYERTAG", "token": "player-generated-token", "status": "ok" }
```

Known status values are believed to be `ok` and `invalid`, but this repo has not live-verified either success response.

## Error Codes

| Code | Meaning                                 |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| 400  | Bad parameters                          |
| 403  | Auth failure / insufficient token scope |
| 404  | Player not found                        |
| 429  | Rate limit exceeded                     |
| 500  | Server error                            |
| 503  | Maintenance                             |

Observed error bodies are usually `{ reason, message? }`. `message` may be absent on some `404` responses, and
`type`/`detail` were not observed.

## Agent Notes

- **Optional fields:** `clan`, `role`, and `leagueStatistics` are completely absent (not null) when the player has no
  clan / no league history. Always check for key existence. However, `currentPathOfLegendSeasonResult`,
  `lastPathOfLegendSeasonResult`, `bestPathOfLegendSeasonResult`, and `legacyTrophyRoadHighScore` are always present but
  use `null` when not applicable — check for both key existence and null.
- `currentDeck` (8 cards) vs `cards` (full collection) vs battle-log card arrays: all three carry `evolutionLevel` but
  with **different semantics** (ownership vs deployment vs played-as-in-battle — see the evolutionLevel section above).
  `cards[]` also includes `count` of copies currently in stash.
- `role` values: `member`, `elder`, `coLeader`, `leader`
- Path of Legend `rank` field is null when the player hasn't achieved a rank yet
- **Path of Legend arena IDs:** both `72000450 Ranked1v1_NewArena` and `72000464 Ranked1v1_NewArena2` appear on live
  `pathOfLegend` battles. Treat both as current PoL arenas. Within-clan sampling is not enough to tell which arena is
  "active" globally — PoL is high-level play and only a handful of our members reach it, so apparent drops in one ID can
  simply mean an active PoL player moved up or down a tier.
- **Sampling caveat:** every count and enum frequency in this doc is computed from one clan's members. Absence of a
  value does not mean Supercell removed it; presence at low counts does not mean it is rare in general. Use observed-IDs
  as a "definitely exists" signal and treat absence as "we have no data" rather than "doesn't happen."
- Battlelog returns a bare array (like `/events`), not a paginated response — no `paging` object. Returns ~30-40 battles
  (most commonly 30).
- `progress` is a map of side-mode season results (Merge Tactics / AutoChess) — keys are mode season identifiers. Empty
  string key `""` = legacy/default season.
- `progress` keys should be treated as opaque identifiers, not a stable enum. Parse the nested values, not the key
  naming pattern.
- `battleTime` format is `YYYYMMDDTHHmmss.sssZ` — parse carefully, no dashes or colons
- `leagueStatistics.currentSeason` has no `id` field (it's the current season)
- **2v2 battles:** `team` and `opponent` each contain 2 entries instead of 1
- **Battle winner detection:** Apply the explicit precedence above: `boatBattleWon` -> `trophyChange` -> crowns ->
  unresolved
- Additional battle variants observed in March 2026 sampling: `riverRaceDuelColosseum` and an occasional `unknown` type
  on friendlies
- For player-facing text, avoid raw `Evolution Level N` wording; prefer `Evo`, `Hero`, or `Evo + Hero`
- Additional `deckSelection` values observed in March 2026 sampling: `pick`, `draftCompetitive`, `predefined`
- **Tournament battles:** `type=tournament` battles include a `tournamentTag` field that links back to
  `/tournaments/{tag}`. This allows matching battles to specific tournaments. The `gameMode` distinguishes tournament
  format: `72000009`/`Tournament` for bring-your-own-deck, `72000194`/`Draft_Competitive` for Triple Draft. In draft
  tournaments, each battle has different cards (drafted per match); in standard tournaments, players use their
  `collection` deck.
- **Tournament battle dedup:** Both players in a match see the same `battleTime`. Dedup key: `battleTime` + sorted pair
  of `(team[0].tag, opponent[0].tag)`. For tournament winner detection, use crowns comparison (no `trophyChange` field
  on tournament battles). The `startingTrophies` field on tournament battles reflects tournament score, not ladder
  trophies.
- **Tournament battle log retention:** Battle logs are not permanent (~30-40 battles). Tournament battles will rotate
  out as players play more games. To capture tournament battle data reliably, poll player battle logs shortly after the
  tournament ends. Battles from a 13-player tournament were partially lost within ~24h due to active players' logs
  rotating.
- **Badges:** Two categories — progress badges (with `level`/`maxLevel`/`progress`/`target`) and one-time badges
  (`level`, `maxLevel`, and `target` are **absent** — not present as `null` — only `name`, `progress`, and `iconUrls`
  are guaranteed). Mastery badges are per-card (e.g. `MasteryKnight`).
- **Achievements:** Fixed set of 12 achievements. `stars` (0-3) indicates completion tier. `completionInfo` is typically
  null.
