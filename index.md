# Clash Royale API — Reference Index

This is a reference documentation set for the Clash Royale API (`https://api.clashroyale.com/v1`). Each endpoint file
covers a domain of routes, parameters, response types, and implementation notes. The repo also includes gameplay-mode
context for interpreting player activity beyond Trophy Road.

Verified against live API: March–April 2026.

---

## Common Patterns

### Authentication

All endpoints require a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header. Tokens are created at
[developer.clashroyale.com](https://developer.clashroyale.com) and are IP-restricted.

### Tag Encoding

Player, clan, and tournament tags start with `#` which must be URL-encoded as `%23` in path parameters:

`#2ABC` → `%232ABC`

This applies to all endpoints that accept a tag in the path (`playerTag`, `clanTag`, `tournamentTag`).

### Pagination

Endpoints that return lists support cursor-based pagination:

- `limit` — maximum number of items to return
- `after` — cursor for next page (from `paging.cursors.after` in response)
- `before` — cursor for previous page (from `paging.cursors.before` in response)

`after` and `before` are mutually exclusive. Omit both for the first page.

Paginated responses always wrap data in `{ items: [...], paging: { cursors: { after?, before? } } }`.

**Exceptions** — these endpoints return bare arrays (no wrapper, no pagination):

- `GET /players/{playerTag}/battlelog`
- `GET /events`

### Response Shapes

The API uses three distinct collection response patterns:

| Shape                                        | Meaning                      | Examples                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bare array                                   | Non-paginated list response  | `/events`, `/players/{playerTag}/battlelog`                                  |
| `{ items: [...] }`                           | Non-paginated object wrapper | `/leaderboards`, `/globaltournaments`, `/players/{playerTag}/upcomingchests` |
| `{ items: [...], paging: { cursors: ... } }` | Paginated list response      | `/locations`, `/clans/{tag}/members`, `/tournaments`, `/leaderboard/{id}`    |

Do not assume that every response with `items` is paginated. Presence of `paging` is the reliable signal.

### Datetime Format

All datetime strings use: `YYYYMMDDTHHmmss.sssZ` (no dashes or colons)

Example: `20260309T135844.000Z`

### Error Responses

Error bodies are not fully consistent. `reason` is always present in observed responses, `message` is present on many
`400` responses but often absent on `404`/`500` responses, and `type`/`detail` were not observed:

| Code | Meaning                                               |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 400  | Bad parameters                                        |
| 403  | Auth failure / insufficient token scope / IP mismatch |
| 404  | Resource not found                                    |
| 410  | Endpoint permanently removed                          |
| 429  | Rate limit exceeded                                   |
| 500  | Server error                                          |
| 503  | Maintenance                                           |

Observed error shapes:

- `{ "reason": "badRequest", "message": "..." }`
- `{ "reason": "notFound" }`
- `{ "reason": "unknownException" }`

Notable `reason` values:

- `accessDenied` — IP doesn't match token or invalid token
- `notFound` — resource or endpoint not found
- `badRequest` — invalid parameter combinations or values
- `gone` — endpoint permanently removed
- `unknownException` — observed for invalid `leaderboardId`

### Optional vs Null

The API frequently omits optional fields entirely instead of returning `null`.

- Treat missing keys and nullable values as different cases
- Check key existence before reading optional fields
- Most optional fields are absent rather than null, but there are notable exceptions

Examples of absent-when-not-applicable:

- Player `clan`, `role`, `leagueStatistics`
- Tournament `description`, `startedTime`, `endedTime`
- Ranking entry `clan`

Examples of null-when-not-applicable (always present):

- Player `currentPathOfLegendSeasonResult`, `lastPathOfLegendSeasonResult`, `bestPathOfLegendSeasonResult` — null for
  players without Path of Legend history
- Player `legacyTrophyRoadHighScore` — null for players without pre-rework trophy history
- Event `description` — can be null

### Rate Limiting

The API has aggressive rate limiting. Observed behavior:

- No per-quota rate limit headers (no `X-RateLimit-*` style counters)
- Exceeding limits results in 403 `accessDenied` (not always 429)
- Adding ~2 second delays between requests helps avoid rate limit issues
- Rate limits appear to be per-IP, not per-endpoint
- When the API does return 429, a standard `Retry-After` header is included (seconds). Honour it before applying any
  local exponential backoff.

### Caching

The API returns `cache-control: max-age=N` headers indicating server-side cache duration. Observed max-age values:

| Endpoint Category                                 | Cache Duration |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `/events`                                         | ~600s (10 min) |
| `/locations`                                      | ~600s (10 min) |
| `/clans/{tag}`, `/currentriverrace`               | ~120s (2 min)  |
| `/players/{tag}`, `/battlelog`, `/upcomingchests` | ~60s (1 min)   |
| `/leaderboards`, `/leaderboard/{id}`              | ~60s (1 min)   |
| `/cards`                                          | ~30s           |
| `/rankings/*`, `/pathoflegend/*`                  | ~60s (1 min)   |

These are countdown timers — the actual value returned decreases as the cache ages. Responses are JSON with
`Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`.

### Pagination Details

- Cursors are base64-encoded JSON: `eyJwb3MiOjV9` decodes to `{"pos":5}`
- For paginated endpoints, `limit=0` usually returns `400 badRequest` with
  `Invalid 'limit' parameter used in the request`
- Some non-paginated endpoints ignore pagination params instead of rejecting them:
  - `/cards?limit=1` still returns the full catalog
  - `/cards?limit=0` still returns the full catalog
  - `/events?limit=5` still returns the full bare array
- No explicit maximum for `limit` — the API will return all results if no limit is set (observed 10,000 items from
  `/leaderboard/{id}`)
- When no more pages exist, `paging.cursors` is an empty object `{}`
- When more pages exist, `paging.cursors.after` contains the next cursor
- HEAD requests are not supported (return 404)

## Cross-Reference Notes

- **Global tournaments → location rankings:** Use `tournamentTag` from `/globaltournaments` with
  `/locations/global/rankings/tournaments/{tournamentTag}` to get player rankings
- **Classic war endpoints are dead:** `currentwar` is permanently removed (410 Gone); `warlog` is disabled (404). Only
  river race endpoints work.
- **Trophy rankings vs Ranked / Path of Legend:** These are separate leaderboards at the same location —
  `/rankings/players` for Trophy Road, `/pathoflegend/players` for Ranked / Path of Legend. The game/wiki now uses
  Ranked wording, while the API still uses `pathoflegend` names.
- **Leaderboards vs location rankings:** `/leaderboards` cover game modes (Merge Tactics, Touchdown, etc.);
  `/locations/{id}/rankings` are geography-specific trophy rankings
- **Tournaments vs global tournaments:** `/tournaments` covers player-created tournaments; `/globaltournaments` covers
  Supercell-run events. Different model types (`Tournament` vs `LadderTournament`)
- **Season format:** League season IDs use `YYYY-MM` format (e.g. `2025-01`) — use `/seasons` endpoint to discover valid
  IDs
- **Bare array responses:** `/events` and `/battlelog` return bare JSON arrays, not the standard `{ items: [...] }`
  wrapper
- **Events ↔ Battles:** `Battle.eventTag` maps to `TrailEvent.eventTag` from `/events`
- **Challenges ↔ Events:** While `/challenges` is currently undocumented and returning `notFound`, active challenge-like
  events still appear in `/events` (e.g. "Classic Challenge", "Grand Challenge")
- **Gameplay-mode context:** Use [game-modes.md](game-modes.md) before assuming `PvP`/Trophy Road activity is the only
  meaningful player activity. Ranked, Clan Wars, tournaments, events, 2v2, and side modes have separate signals.
- **Clan search flexibility:** `name` is not required — you can search by `locationId`, `minScore`, `minMembers`, or
  `maxMembers` alone. Search is case-insensitive.
- **River race seasons:** `seasonId` in river race log is a sequential integer (e.g. 127, 128, 129, 130) — not the
  YYYY-MM format used for league seasons
- **Global rankings:** Use `global` as locationId for worldwide rankings. Global player trophy rankings may be empty
  early in a season, but PoL and clan rankings are populated.
- **Season trophy rankings broken:** `/seasons/{id}/rankings/players` returns notFound for all tested seasons
  (2024-2026). PoL season rankings work. This appears to be a long-standing issue, not transient.
- **Odd error codes exist:** Invalid `locationId` values return `400 badRequest`, while invalid `leaderboardId` values
  currently return `500 unknownException` rather than `404`.
