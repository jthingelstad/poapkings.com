# Clash Royale API Agent Reference

This repository is an agent-first documentation set for the public Clash Royale API at `https://api.clashroyale.com/v1`.

It is designed for agentic use: LLM agents, coding agents, automation workflows, and API clients that need a practical,
accurate reference for live endpoint behavior rather than a thin endpoint list.

## What This Provides

- A structured reference for the documented Clash Royale API surface area
- Endpoint-by-endpoint notes on parameters, response shapes, pagination, caching, and error behavior
- Field-level model references based on live API responses
- Gameplay-mode context so agents do not treat Trophy Road as the only meaningful player activity surface
- Coverage of known quirks, broken endpoints, removed endpoints, and inconsistent behaviors
- Cross-links between related resources such as players, clans, river race, locations, rankings, tournaments, cards,
  events, and leaderboards

## Intended Use

This repo is written to be consumed by agents as much as by humans.

That means it emphasizes:

- Deterministic endpoint descriptions
- Observed response schemas
- Edge cases and failure modes
- Notes about deprecated or misleading API behavior
- Practical implementation details an agent can use when generating code, tools, tests, or integrations

If you are building an autonomous or semi-autonomous client, this collection is meant to reduce guesswork.

## Recommended Agent Workflow

If an agent is using this repo to answer questions, generate integrations, or validate API behavior, the recommended
order is:

1. Start with [index.md](index.md) for common API rules, global caveats, and endpoint discovery.
2. Open the domain file for the target surface area such as [players.md](players.md) or [clans.md](clans.md).
3. Use [models.md](models.md) or the focused files in [models/](models/) to validate field presence, optionality, and
   shared object shapes.
4. Use [game-modes.md](game-modes.md) when interpreting player activity across Trophy Road, Ranked / Path of Legend,
   Clan Wars, events, tournaments, 2v2, and side modes.
5. Prefer observed behavior notes over generic assumptions, especially for pagination, error payloads, and older
   endpoints.
6. Treat endpoints marked broken, disabled, or removed as operational constraints, not temporary noise.

The intended opinionated use is simple: agents should treat this repo as a live-behavior reference, not just a static
API catalog.

## Reference Anchor

For clan-based examples and verification, this documentation uses this sample clan tag:

- `#J2RGCRVG`

Remember that Clash Royale tags must be URL-encoded in paths:

- `#J2RGCRVG` → `%23J2RGCRVG`

## Status

The docs in this repo are intended to reflect live behavior, including places where the API is inconsistent, partially
broken, or no longer maintained cleanly.

Use [index.md](index.md) as the starting point.

## Quality Checks

The Node-based documentation tooling lives in [tools/docs-build/](tools/docs-build/) to keep the repository root focused
on the docs themselves.

Run all checks from the repository root with:

```sh
npm --prefix tools/docs-build run build
```

Run Markdown formatting with:

```sh
npm --prefix tools/docs-build run format
```

To enable the versioned local Git hooks in a fresh clone, run:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath tools/git-hooks
```

The local `pre-commit` and `pre-push` hooks run the same docs build as CI.
