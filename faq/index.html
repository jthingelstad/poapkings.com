    <section>
      <h2 class="sectionTitle">About the Clan</h2>
      <details open>
        <summary>Why did you create POAP KINGS?</summary>
        <p>A clan for players who want more than a random group — structure, recognition, and something lasting to show for the grind. Consistent players get rewarded, milestones get commemorated, and every season leaves proof.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Why the name POAP KINGS?</summary>
        <p>POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) is a blockchain system for collectible digital tokens that mark real participation. We use it to give members a permanent record of each season. Kings because we aim high. "Proof of Arena Push" is just our Clash-flavored spin on it.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Is POAP KINGS affiliated with Supercell?</summary>
        <p>No. Independent fan community. Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Supercell in any way.</p>
      </details>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="sectionTitle">Joining</h2>
      <details open>
        <summary>How do I join?</summary>
        <p>We're open — no invite needed. Search <strong>POAP KINGS</strong> or use tag <strong class="mono">#J2RGCRVG</strong> in Clash Royale. Minimum <strong>2,000 trophies</strong> to join.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is the Founder POAP?</summary>
        <p>Join within the first two months of the clan and you earn the <strong>FOUNDER POAP</strong> — a one-time badge that marks you as an original member. Window closes permanently after that.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What are the clan rules?</summary>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Be active</strong> — don't ghost a whole season without a heads-up.</li>
          <li><strong>Be generous</strong> — donate when you can.</li>
          <li><strong>Be decent</strong> — no toxicity, no drama.</li>
          <li><strong>Wars encouraged</strong> — participate when possible. Real life comes first; just communicate.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="sectionTitle">Clan Wars</h2>
      <details open>
        <summary>Do I have to participate in Clan Wars?</summary>
        <p>No. Encouraged but not required. Consistent participation and good vibes matter more than strict war requirements. That said, war performance is how you earn War Champ and Free Pass eligibility.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How is War Champ chosen?</summary>
        <p>Top Clan Wars point earner for the season, pulled directly from RoyaleAPI stats — no manual adjustments. Joining mid-season doesn't earn a handicap. Leaders break ties transparently.</p>
      </details>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="sectionTitle">Free Pass Program</h2>
      <details open>
        <summary>What is the Free Pass Program?</summary>
        <p>Top eligible war point earner each season gets a free Pass Royale, sent in-game from King Thing. Real reward, no gimmicks.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How does eligibility work?</summary>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Highest war points among eligible players for the season.</li>
          <li>No back-to-back winners — can't have won last month.</li>
          <li>Points straight from RoyaleAPI, no adjustments.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How are ties broken?</summary>
        <ol class="list">
          <li>Highest donations in the season wins.</li>
          <li>Still tied? Longest tenure in the clan wins.</li>
        </ol>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How will I receive the pass?</summary>
        <p>Sent in-game from King Thing. No PayPal, Venmo, or cash transfers — in-game only.</p>
        <p><em>Exception: If you're under 16, can't receive it in-game, and King Thing knows you in real life, we'll work something out.</em></p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="sectionTitle">POAPs</h2>
      <details open>
        <summary>What is a POAP?</summary>
        <p>A POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) is a collectible digital token on the blockchain that marks your participation in a moment or event. Permanently yours, publicly verifiable. Learn more at <a href="https://poap.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">poap.xyz</a>.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What kinds of POAPs does POAP KINGS issue?</summary>
        <p>Two types:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Clan POAPs</strong> — mark clan-wide milestones: seasons, War Champ, founding. Issued to active members. POAP KINGS logo appears at the <strong>top</strong> of the design.</li>
          <li><strong>Member POAPs</strong> — recognize personal achievements like pushing past 10,000 trophies. These are yours to keep and share however you want, inside or outside the clan. Logo appears at the <strong>bottom</strong> of the design.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Logo position is the quick tell: <strong>top = clan milestone, bottom = your milestone</strong>.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What specific POAPs are issued?</summary>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Seasonal</strong> — active members each season. <em>(Clan)</em></li>
          <li><strong>War Champ</strong> — top war contributor featured on the season POAP. <em>(Clan)</em></li>
          <li><strong>Founder</strong> — one-time badge for original members only. <em>(Clan)</em></li>
          <li><strong>Achievement</strong> — personal milestones like 10k trophies. <em>(Member)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Browse the full history in the <a href="/vault">POAP Vault</a>.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do I need crypto knowledge to claim?</summary>
        <p>Nope. You'll get a claim link — click it and follow the steps. You'll need a free wallet but no purchases or blockchain knowledge required. New to it? Ask in the clan and we'll get you set up.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is a reservation?</summary>
        <p>Confirmation that you're eligible to claim a specific POAP. Issued to qualifying members before the claim link goes out.</p>
      </details>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="sectionTitle">Roles</h2>
      <details open>
        <summary>What's the clan composition?</summary>
        <p>Roughly every 10 members has 1 Co-Leader and 2–3 Elders. It scales as the clan grows — leadership stays proportional, not top-heavy.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What are the roles?</summary>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Member</strong> — standard participant</li>
          <li><strong>Elder</strong> — earned through consistent donations and helping clanmates</li>
          <li><strong>Co-Leader</strong> — trusted veterans with extra responsibilities</li>
          <li><strong>Leader</strong> — King Thing</li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How do I earn Elder?</summary>
        <p>Donate consistently and be helpful. Elder can also be removed if donations dry up long-term — it's an active recognition, not a permanent title.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is King's Keep?</summary>
        <p>The members section of the site — roster, roles, clan history. <a href="/members">Visit King's Keep</a>.</p>
